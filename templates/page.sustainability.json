        "description": "<p>Wellness products are made from responsibly sourced ingredients which are carefully selected and tested for the highest quality. Most of our ingredients are wild harvested, which means they are gathered in their native ecosystem, where they grow wild, rather than being mass-produced on a farm or plantation. In many parts of the world, this process is as simple as harvesters hand-collecting natural, untouched herbs.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Our floss is sourced from silk moths raised ethically and cruelty-free. These silkworms start as eggs, and once hatched, they’re taken outdoors and given water and tender plant leaves. When they mature, they spin their cocoons, which rearers collect and hang in a temperature-controlled room. As the silkworm metamorphoses into a silk moth, it’s kept alive and can break out of the cocoon unharmed. We extract the silk from the cocoons by unwinding the filaments and twisting them into threads.<\/p><p>In addition to our sustainable harvesting, every batch of raw ingredients is tested for chemicals, pesticides, and other synthetic compounds. No ingredient makes it into our formulas without passing our rigorous quality testing.<\/p><p>Working with nature ensures our ingredients are grown in their natural habitat. As a result, several of our ingredients are harvested overseas and are in a much purer form. Working with global partners, we’ve found the most sustainable options for our ingredients.<\/p><p>When formulating our Citrus Body Bar, palm oil was on our wish list of ingredients for its excellent lathering properties. However, irresponsible palm oil harvesting has led to rapid deforestation and wildlife displacement. Sadly, harvesting methods for palm oil alternatives are unethical as well. To solve this, Wellnesse joined The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a not-for-profit that aids businesses in harvesting sustainable palm oil, allowing us to be mindful of the planet while providing the highest quality possible.<\/p>",

Sugarcane resin is a fantastic alternative to traditional plastic packaging and produces far fewer carbon emissions during manufacturing. It has a resilient shelf life, meaning our packaging won't melt, break down, or leach into your products. It's also a renewable resource, making it far more sustainable and eco-friendly than plastic.<\/p><p>Several of our products come in glass jars, which are always recyclable. Our mineral deodorant is packaged in recycled and recyclable cardboard. Our Copper tongue scraper lasts for many years. And our silk floss, toothbrushes, and floss pick handles are all biodegradable. Our lids are made from the cleanest-sourced, recyclable plastic available, meaning no part of your Wellnesse products ever has to go in the trash!<\/p><p>Being an e-commerce company means that we have an even bigger responsibility to protect the planet. We minimize packaging by shipping all orders in the smallest cardboard box they fit in and encourage customers to shop in bulk as much as possible. We skip wrapping our products in plastic wrap, further reducing our carbon footprint.<\/p>",
